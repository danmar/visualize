visualize
=========

visualize code. the goal is to rely heavily on comments in the code.

this is highly experimental right now.

State machines
--------------

The statemachine.py script detect state machines in the code and generate corresponding dot files.

For this to work, the state machine must use a enum variable for the state. And the state machine must be implemented with a switch.
